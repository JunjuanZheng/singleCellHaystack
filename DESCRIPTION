Description: `singleCellHaystack` is a package for finding surprising 
    needles (=genes) in haystacks (=2D representations of single cell 
    transcriptome data). Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data is often 
    represented in 2-dimentional plots (e.g. plots of two principal 
    components, or t-SNE plots). `singleCellHaystack` can be used for 
    finding genes that are expressed in subsets of cells that are 
    non-randomly distributed in this 2D representation.
