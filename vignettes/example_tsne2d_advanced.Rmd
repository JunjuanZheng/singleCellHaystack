# tl;dr

You can indicate the general expression levels of cells using input parameter `use.advanced.sampling`. If you do that,`singleCellHaystack` takes the general expression levels into account and finds genes that are different from that general expression pattern.

# Preparing the input data

The data used in these examples can be found [here](https://genomics.virus.kyoto-u.ac.jp/alexisvdb/singleCellHaystack/). We recommend downloading the .rda file and loading it using the `load()` function. You can also download the individual data files separately.

```{r example0}
load(url("https://genomics.virus.kyoto-u.ac.jp/alexisvdb/singleCellHaystack/tabula_muris_marrow_P7_2.rda"))
ls()
```

This data should include the following objects:

- `dat.expression`: a matrix object with the expression of genes (rows) in each cell (columns).
- `dat.detection`:  a logical matrix object with the detection of genes (rows) in each cell (columns). TRUE means detected, FALSE means not detected.
- `dat.pca`:        the output of PCA. This data.frame contains thefirst 50 pricipal components.
- `dat.tsne`:       a data.frame with t-SNE coordinates (2D).
- `dat.umap`:       a data.frame with UMAP coordinates (2D).

Let's have a look at the t-SNE plot, colouring cells be the number of genes detected in each cell:

```{r example1}
general.detection <- apply(dat.detection, 2, sum)
ggplot(dat.tsne, aes_string(x = "V1", y = "V2", colour = general.detection)) + labs(x = "t-SNE1", y = "t-SNE2") + 
geom_point(size=2) + scale_color_gradient(low="yellow", high="red") + labs(color = "Det. genes")
```
There are several groups of cells,although the borders between are not clear and several might consist of additional subclusters.

Moreover, the cells in the bottom right have in general fewer detected genes. If a gene is detected predominantly in these cells and not in others, this tendency goes against the general trend in expression. Such a trend would be especially surprizing.

We can use `singleCellHaystack` to find genes with biased expression patterns in this 2D plot, taking into account general gene expression trends, using the option `use.advanced.sampling`.

# Application of `singleCellHaystack` in advanced mode

First, load the package, and set a random seed to ensure replicability.

```{r example2}
library(singleCellHaystack)
set.seed(1)
```

Next, run `haystack` on the t-SNE coordinates. These are 2D coordinates, so we set 'method' to '2D'. We also give the detection values as input to 'detection'. `use.advanced.sampling` is set to the vector of detected genes per cell, `general.detection`. By doing this, `haystack` will calculate cell distributions and perform randomizations taking into account the general detection levels.

```{r example3}
res.tsne.adv <- haystack(x = dat.tsne, detection = dat.detection, use.advanced.sampling = general.detection, method = "2D")
```

Let's have a look at the most biased genes. The most strongly biased gene is Trim10. We can plot the expression an detection of this gene using the `plot_gene_haystack` function.

```{r example4}
show_result_haystack(res.haystack = res.tsne.adv, n = 5)
# plotting detection of this gene
plot_gene_haystack(x = dat.tsne, gene = "Trim10", expression = dat.detection)
# plotting log expression of this gene
plot_gene_haystack(x = dat.tsne, gene = "Trim10", expression = log10(dat.expression)) 
```

From these plots, we can see that Trim10 is expressed almost exclusively in the bottom right group of cells. As seen above, these cells have in general fewer detected genes, so the pattern of Trim10 is especially surprizing: it is deteced in cells that express in general few genes.

This explains why the advanced mode of `singleCellHaystack` judges Trim10 to be the most significantly biased.

Compare the pattern of Trim10 with that of Alox5ap, the most biased gene in the default mode (see [here](articles/example_tsne2D_default.html)). Alox5ap is strongly biased, but is detected in cells that have in general many detected genes.

Next, let's take the top 1000 biased genes, and cluster them by their expression pattern in the 2D t-SNE coordinates. Here we use `hclust_haystack`, which uses hierarchical clustering. Alternatively, we could use `kmeans_haystack` for k-means clustering.

```{r example5}
# get the top 1000 biased genes in the result
res.top <- show_result_haystack(res.haystack = res.tsne.adv, n = 1000)
# cluster biased genes by their expression pattern in the 2D plot
genes.top <- row.names(res.top)
res.hc <- hclust_haystack(x = dat.tsne, genes = genes.top, detection = dat.detection)
```

`hclust_haystack` returns as result a `hclust` tree, which we can cut into clusters using the `cutree` function. Here, we arbitrarily set the number of clusters to 5.

```{r example6}
res.hc.clusters <- cutree(res.hc, k=5)
table(res.hc.clusters)
``` 

Let's run through the 5 clusters and plot their averaged detection pattern using `plot_gene_set_haystack`, which is similar to `plot_gene_haystack` but uses a set of genes as input instead of just 1 gene. 

```{r example7, fig.height = 9, fig.width = 8, fig.align='center'}
pl <- lapply(1:5, function(cluster) {
  gene.set <- names(res.hc.clusters)[res.hc.clusters==cluster]
  plot.title <- paste0("Cluster ", cluster)
  p <- plot_gene_set_haystack(x = dat.tsne, genes = gene.set, detection = dat.detection)
  p + ggtitle(plot.title) + theme(legend.title = element_text(size = 8))
})
plot_grid(plotlist = pl, ncol = 2)
```

```{r example8}
res.hc.clusters["Trim10"] # the most biased gene is in cluster 4
```
The most biased genes, Trim10, was clustered into cluster 4. Comparing its expression pattern (see above) with that of each cluster, we can indeed see that it fits most closely with that of cluster 4. Cluster 4 genes are on average detected almost exclusively in the bottom right group of cells.
